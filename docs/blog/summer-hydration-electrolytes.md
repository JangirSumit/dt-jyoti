High heat and humidity increase fluid and electrolyte needs.

## Daily targets (general guidance)
- Most adults: ~30–35 ml/kg/day water from fluids + foods
- Increase intake with outdoor work, exercise, or fever

## Electrolyte basics
- Sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium support fluid balance
- Use ORS or homemade options (water + pinch of salt + lemon + sugar) when needed

## Cooling choices
- Buttermilk/chaas, coconut water, lemon water, seasonal fruits (watermelon, muskmelon)
- Limit very sugary drinks and excessive caffeine

> Caution: If you have kidney/heart conditions, follow medical advice on fluid limits.
