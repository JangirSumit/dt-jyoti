Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are products that are heavily refined and often high in added sugars, unhealthy fats, salt, and additives. Think packaged snacks, instant noodles, sugary drinks, and many ready-to-eat meals.

## Why it matters
- High UPF intake is associated with weight gain, metabolic issues, and poor diet quality.
- These foods are engineered for palatability, making portion control harder.

## Spotting UPFs quickly
- Long ingredient lists with many additives
- Words like "emulsifiers", "stabilizers", "isolates", "flavor enhancers"

## Simple swaps
- Chips → roasted chana / nuts
- Sugary drinks → water, buttermilk, coconut water
- Instant noodles → whole wheat/semiya + veggies + eggs/paneer

## Keep it practical
- Aim for 70–80% whole/minimally processed foods.
- Keep healthy snacks visible and accessible.
