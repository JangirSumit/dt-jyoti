A diverse and balanced gut microbiome supports digestion, immunity, and overall well-being.

## Probiotics vs Prebiotics
- Probiotics: Beneficial bacteria (e.g., yogurt cultures)
- Prebiotics: Fibers that feed good bacteria (e.g., onions, garlic, bananas)

## Everyday sources
- Probiotics: Yogurt/curd, kefir, fermented foods (idli/dosa batter, kanji)
- Prebiotics: Whole grains, fruits, legumes, veggies

## Habits that help
- Aim 25–35g fiber/day (gradually increase + water)
- Regular meals, quality sleep, and stress management

> Note: For IBS/IBD or GI concerns, seek individualized care.
