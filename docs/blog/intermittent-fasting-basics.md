Intermittent fasting (IF) is an eating pattern that cycles between periods of eating and fasting. Popular approaches include 16:8, 14:10, or time-restricted feeding aligned with daytime.

## Potential benefits
- May support weight management and insulin sensitivity
- Can simplify meal timing and reduce late-night eating

## Who should avoid or modify IF
- Pregnant or lactating individuals
- People with a history of eating disorders
- Those on certain medications or with medical conditions

## Practical tips
- Prioritize protein, fiber, and hydration in eating windows
- Start gently (12:12) and listen to biofeedback (sleep, energy, mood)
