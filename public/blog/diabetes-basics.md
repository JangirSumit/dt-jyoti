Living with diabetes doesn’t mean bland food or giving up your favorites. The key is balance, timing, and portions.

## Principles
- Prefer complex carbs (millets, brown rice, oats) over refined carbs.
- Pair carbs with protein and healthy fats to reduce spikes.
- Fill half your plate with high-fiber vegetables.
- Hydrate well; avoid sugar-sweetened beverages.

## Sample Day
- Breakfast: Oats porridge with chia + boiled eggs or paneer.
- Snack: Apple with a handful of nuts.
- Lunch: Roti (multigrain) + dal + mixed veg + salad.
- Snack: Buttermilk or roasted chana.
- Dinner: Grilled fish/tofu + quinoa + sautéed veggies.

> Monitor glucose response and adjust carb portions accordingly.
